        <p><b>My Transfer Costs</b> is a useful utility application for calculating the fees involved in purchasing a house in South Africa.
        It brings with it the ability to email a generated quote to one's self as well as a client</p>
        
        <p>To use the app, one simply has to fill in the full amount of the purchase as well as the amount of the mortage or just one of the two.
        One then also has to select what should be calculated. Please note that the selection and info should correspond. Once ready one simply has
        to press the "calculate" button to be directed to the pricing estimate (quote). From there the email button can be used to email the quotation.
        The email address specified at the start is the email address to where the quote will be CC'ed and should probably be your own. The name that
        you enter at the begining should also be your own, it is used only for personalization on the quote page.</p>
